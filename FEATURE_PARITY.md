## Known Issues

### Minor
1. **Supersaw random phases** - Similarity varies 73-83% due to random initial phases (inherent limitation)
2. **FM on saw/square** - Band-limited oscillators react differently to audio-rate FM

### Resolved
- ~~HPF basic~~ - Fixed by switching to BHiPass biquad filter (76.5% → 82.2%)
- ~~Filter Q scaling~~ - Fixed with 1/sqrt(Q) mapping (65% → 84-96%)
- ~~BPF gain mismatch~~ - Fixed by routing through strudel_filter module (65% → 82%)
- ~~Synth double envelope~~ - Fixed by removing internal ADSR from synths
- ~~Noise "broken"~~ - Not broken, just random - RMS levels match within 1dB
- ~~Pan law~~ - Now 92-94% at all positions (was 84.1%)
- ~~Delay feedback~~ - Now 88-90% with feedback mapping adjustments (was 77.9%)
- ~~Supersaw defaults~~ - Fixed detune/spread defaults and panning algorithm

## Changelog

### 2026-01-06 (Session 9)
- Implemented convolution reverb using PartConv
  - Added `strudel_convrev` module for impulse response-based reverb
  - Supports `ir` (sample name), `irspeed` (not yet implemented), `irbegin` (not yet implemented)
  - Uses PartConv with FFT size 2048 for efficient real-time convolution
  - Spectral buffers are prepared and cached for each unique IR sample

  - Changed default spread from 0.6 to 0.4 (matches WebAudio panspread)
  - Switched from linear pan spread to alternating L/R pattern (odd=left, even=right)
  - Note: Similarity varies 73-83% due to random phase initialization in both backends
- Verified delay and pan improvements from previous session
  - **Delay**: 77.9% → 89.0% (+11.1%) - feedback mapping working well
  - **Pan**: 84.1% → 93.5% (+9.4%) - now consistent across all positions
- Fixed FM envelope smart defaults to match superdough's getADSRValues behavior
  - When only `fmdecay` is set, sustain now defaults to 0.001 (AD envelope)

  - **FM + envelope**: 67.1% → 96.8% (+29.7%) - major improvement
- Fixed BPF Q mapping: use 1/Q instead of 1/sqrt(Q) for bandpass filters
